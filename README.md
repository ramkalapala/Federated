# Federated
Digital healthcare insurance systems has generated vast amounts of demographic, behavioral, biometric, and claims-related data, creating opportunities for personalized premium modeling and proactive fraud detection.
However, traditional centralized machine learning approaches require aggregating sensitive medical and financial information into a single repository, increasing the risk of data breaches and regulatory non-compliance under frameworks such as HIPAA and GDPR. A unified federated intelligence approach addresses these concerns by enabling decentralized collaborative learning, where institutions train models locally and exchange only model parameters rather than raw data.
The implemented notebook provides the foundational prototype of this decentralized paradigm by simulating multiple client nodes that independently train models on partitioned insurance datasets. Using Federated Averaging (FedAvg), local model updates are aggregated at a central coordinator to produce global.
